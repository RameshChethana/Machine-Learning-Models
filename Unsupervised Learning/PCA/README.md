# PCA Implementation

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is showcased in this notebook as a powerful technique for condensing high-dimensional datasets into a more manageable form while preserving essential information. The primary objective of PCA is to reduce dimensionality while retaining as much variance as possible. By identifying and capturing the most influential aspects of the data, PCA reorients it along its principal components, which are orthogonal directions capturing maximum variance.

## Overview

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
Demonstrates the use of PCA on the "Real estate" dataset by standardizing features and reducing dimensions to visualize the components.

### Model Evaluation
Utilizes several regression models (KNeighborsRegressor, Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, and SVR) to evaluate their performance on the reduced-dimensional dataset obtained through PCA.

## Key Insights

### PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
Displays the impact of reducing dimensions on model performance and visualizes data using scatter plots post-PCA transformation.

### Model Evaluation
Compares Mean Squared Error (MSE) for different models on the original and reduced-dimensional data to assess the impact of PCA.

## Observations

- **PCA's Impact on Models**: The notebook evaluates various regression models on the reduced-dimensional dataset and compares their performance metrics (MSE) with those on the original dataset. This allows observing the models' effectiveness in predicting the target variable after PCA transformation.

- **Visualization**: Scatter plots illustrate model predictions on the reduced-dimensional data, aiding in the assessment of how PCA affects model predictions.
