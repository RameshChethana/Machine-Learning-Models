# Decision Trees

This notebook explores the application and insights derived from Decision Trees in both classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees are interpretable models that partition datasets into smaller subsets, creating a tree-like structure to make predictions based on various features.

## Key Concepts

### Algorithm
Decision Trees split data based on features to maximize information gain, resulting in nodes representing distinct features and leaf nodes indicating final decisions or outputs.

### Advantages
Known for interpretability, handling both numerical and categorical data, and requiring minimal data preprocessing. Additionally, they can capture non-linear patterns effectively.

### Disadvantages
Prone to overfitting with deeper trees, sensitive to small data variations, and may not suit linear relationships.

## Dataset Analysis

### Dataset Used
Utilizes a diabetes dataset, focusing on 'Glucose' and 'BloodPressure' to determine diabetes presence. Visualizations showcase the data distribution, highlighting the absence (blue) or presence (red) of diabetes.

## Model Building and Analysis

### Training and Testing
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with decision tree models fitted on the training data.

### Visualizations
The decision tree models' visual representations help understand the model's decision-making process based on 'Glucose' and 'BloodPressure.'

### Evaluation Metrics
Confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-scores offer insights into model performance.

### Impact of Tree Depth
Analyzes how altering the decision tree's depth affects predictive performance.

## Conclusion

The analysis suggests that changing the tree's depth within a certain range minimally affects predictive performance. Precision scores remain stable, implying consistent classification accuracy across varying tree depths.
