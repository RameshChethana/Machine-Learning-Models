# K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview

The "K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)" notebook explores the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm, a straightforward yet effective supervised learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It delves into the principles, advantages, and limitations of KNN, emphasizing its non-parametric, instance-based nature.

## Algorithm Description

KNN operates by identifying data points in close proximity to a new instance in the feature space. For classification, it assigns a class label based on the majority class among its K nearest neighbors; for regression, it predicts a value based on the mean of its K nearest neighbors' values.

## Pros and Cons

Pros include simplicity, versatility in handling both classification and regression tasks, and robustness to noisy data. However, it has cons such as computational intensity during prediction and sensitivity to irrelevant features.

## Contents

The notebook covers essential libraries for data operations, data visualization, data preprocessing using Sklearn, and key steps in implementing KNN for classification and regression:
