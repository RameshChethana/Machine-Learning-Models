# Ensemble Learning

## Introduction

The "Ensemble Learning.ipynb" notebook discusses Ensemble Learning in machine learning, where multiple models combine to create a more accurate predictor. It explores various ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking, outlining their advantages, disadvantages, and a library named ML-Ensemble that efficiently builds ensemble networks using Scikit-learn's API and computational graph frameworks.

## Data Analysis

The notebook uses the "advertising.csv" dataset to analyze patterns related to advertisement clicks. It explores data distributions, missing values, duplicated data, and relationships between different features using visualization techniques like histograms, joint plots, count plots, pair plots, and heatmaps.

## Multivariable Logistic Regression

This section includes the implementation of Multivariable Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn. It involves splitting the data into training and test sets, fitting the Logistic Regression model, evaluating it using confusion matrices, generating a classification report, and plotting ROC curves.

## Random Forest Classifier

Another model, the Random Forest Classifier, is implemented, trained, and evaluated using the same dataset. It assesses the model's accuracy on both the training and test sets, displays confusion matrices, and generates classification reports for evaluation.

## Decision Tree

A Decision Tree Classifier is trained and evaluated to predict advertisement clicks. It computes accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports, providing insights into its predictive performance.

## Ensemble

The notebook introduces the VotingClassifier ensemble, combining Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models. It evaluates and compares the accuracy of individual classifiers against the VotingClassifier and visualizes confusion matrices for the VotingClassifier's predictions.

## Conclusion

The results from applying different algorithms for predicting internet user ad clicks are discussed. Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and the VotingClassifier ensemble are evaluated for their predictive performance, highlighting the highest accuracy achieved by Random Forest and the effectiveness of ensembles in improving predictive capability.

The README summarizes the steps taken in the notebook, highlighting the analysis, model implementations, evaluations, and conclusions drawn from the prediction task on ad clicks.
