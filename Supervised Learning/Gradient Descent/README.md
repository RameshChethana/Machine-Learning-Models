# Gradient Descent

## Overview

The "Gradient Descent.ipynb" notebook demonstrates the application and significance of gradient descent optimization techniques in machine learning. It explores both Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent methods, fundamental algorithms used for parameter optimization in models.

## Introduction

Gradient descent is a widely employed optimization algorithm in machine learning, utilized to minimize a function iteratively by moving in the direction of the steepest descent, as defined by the negative of the gradient. This notebook explains the concept behind gradient descent and its crucial role in updating model parameters to minimize cost functions, such as mean squared error (MSE).

## Batch Gradient Descent

The notebook covers the application of batch gradient descent, emphasizing its iterative process to update parameters using the entire dataset. It showcases how the algorithm fine-tunes model parameters, such as slope and intercept in linear regression, by minimizing the error between predicted and actual values. Additionally, it visualizes the MSE across epochs to demonstrate the optimization progress.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent

An introduction to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is provided, highlighting its distinction from batch gradient descent. SGD updates parameters using a single randomly chosen data point at each step, offering computational efficiency but with noisier convergence. The notebook illustrates the application of SGD, visualizing the MSE evolution over epochs during optimization.

## Application and Impact

Both gradient descent methods play a pivotal role in machine learning models, influencing optimization, convergence, and computational efficiency. These algorithms are foundational in training various models, including linear regression and neural networks, offering trade-offs between convergence smoothness and computational resources.

## Conclusion

The "Gradient Descent.ipynb" notebook serves as an insightful resource detailing the mechanics, application, and impact of gradient descent algorithms. It elucidates their role in optimizing model parameters and improving model performance by minimizing cost functions in machine learning.
