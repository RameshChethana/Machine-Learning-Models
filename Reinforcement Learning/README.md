# Reinforcement Learning Basics

This notebook introduces fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning (RL) and showcases its key components: Environment, Agent, Action, and Reward. RL is a learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment through a process of trial and error.

## Components of RL

- **Environment**: Represents the context where the agent operates. It responds to the agent's actions and provides feedback or observations based on those actions.

- **Agent**: The decision-making entity that interacts with the environment, perceiving its state, selecting actions, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

- **Action**: Decisions or moves made by the agent within the environment. Actions impact the environment's state and may lead to new observations.

- **Reward**: Numerical values provided by the environment to the agent after taking an action. Rewards serve as feedback to guide the agent toward its objective, maximizing cumulative rewards over time.

## Code Overview

The notebook contains Python code exemplifying the above components:

- **Environment Class**: Simulates an environment where an agent interacts, observes, takes actions, and receives rewards. The class provides methods for observations, available actions, checking game completion, and action implementation with associated rewards.

- **Agent Class**: Represents the learning entity that interacts with the environment. It receives observations, selects actions, and accumulates rewards based on these actions.

- **Execution Loop**: Illustrates the interaction loop between the agent and the environment, demonstrating the agent's steps, observations, actions, and cumulative rewards.

## Code Refinement Strategies

The notebook suggests strategies to refine the code:

- **Defined Reward Points**: Implement a specific reward system where each correct step yields predefined points, enhancing consistency in the reward system.

- **Goal-Oriented Approach**: Establish clear steps or objectives guiding the agent towards a defined goal within the environment, providing structured milestones for the agent's learning process.

By implementing these strategies, the code becomes more structured and controlled, defining the reward system and the steps required for the agent to achieve its goals within the environment.
