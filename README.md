# Machine Learning Models Overview

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various machine learning models categorized into three main types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

## Supervised Learning Models



This repository contains implementations and detailed explanations of various machine learning models showcasing different learning paradigms, optimization techniques, and ensemble methods.

### Perceptron


The Perceptron is a fundamental single-layer neural network used for binary classification tasks. It consists of input nodes, weights, a summation function, and an activation function. This section explores the architecture, learning process, and application of the Perceptron model from scratch.


### Deep Neural Network (DNN)


Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) represent a multi-layered neural network architecture capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data. This section delves into the principles, architecture, and applications of DNNs.


### Ensemble Learning


Ensemble Learning involves combining multiple individual models to create a more robust and accurate predictor than any single model. This section covers various ensemble methods, including bagging, boosting, and stacking.


### Gradient Descent


Gradient Descent is a critical optimization technique used for minimizing a function iteratively by moving in the direction of the steepest descent. This section explores different variants of Gradient Descent.


### Linear Regression
Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear approach.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is used for binary classification, estimating the probability of a sample belonging to a specific class.

### Decision Trees
Decision trees make decisions by splitting the data based on features to create a tree-like structure for both classification and regression tasks.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)
SVMs are powerful classifiers that create decision boundaries to separate different classes in the data.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN predicts the label of a data point by analyzing the majority labels of its nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## Unsupervised Learning Models

### K-Means Clustering
K-Means groups data points into clusters based on similarities, aiming to minimize the variance within clusters.


### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
PCA is used for dimensionality reduction by transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.


## Reinforcement Learning Models

### Q-Learning
Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning technique that learns to make decisions by estimating the value of taking actions in a given state.
